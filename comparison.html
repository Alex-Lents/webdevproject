    <h1>Extra Tips</h1>
    <ul class="tips">
        <li class="tip">Avoid using red and green as colors to stand for two variables in your data visualizations. Red-green color-blindness is the most common form of color blindness, and many people will thus find it hard if not impossible to visually tell the two variables apart</li>
        <li class="tip">You should try to make your visualizations as easy to understand as possible; however, a visualization not being near instantly-discernable is not necessarily a bad thing</li>
        <li class="tip">Try adding elements of interactivity into your visualizations where possible. It's often said that experience is the best teacher, and data visualizations are no different in this regard</li>
        <li class="tip">Generally, you should try to limit how many unnecessary lines and borders there are in your visualizations. This is known as increasing the data-ink ratio, and it lets the viewer focus more on the data itself</li>
        <li class="tip">Sometimes no chart is the best way to display data. You should just use a table when it is important to refer to specific numeric values, when precise rather than relative comparisons between values are needed, or when values displayed have different units or very different magnitudes</li>
